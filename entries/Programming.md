# Programming

Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

## Overview

Programming involves core concepts that span across different languages and paradigms, forming the foundation of software development.

### Key Concepts

- **Variables**: Data storage
- **Control Flow**: Decision making and loops
- **Functions**: Code organization and reuse
- **Data Structures**: Organizing data
- **Algorithms**: Problem-solving methods
